Alice and Bob each created one problem for HackerRank. A reviewer rates the two challenges, awarding points on a scale
from 1 to 100 for three categories: problem clarity, originality, and difficulty.

We define the rating for Alice's challenge to be the triplet A = (a0, a1, a2) , and the rating for Bob's challenge to be
the triplet B = (b0,b1,b2).

Your task is to find their comparison points by comparing a0 with b0, a1 with b1, and a2 with b2.

    If ai > bi, then Alice is awarded 1 point.
    If ai < bi then Bob is awarded 1 point.
    If ai = ai then neither person receives a point.

Comparison points is the total points a person earned.

Given A and B, can you compare the two challenges and print their respective comparison points?
